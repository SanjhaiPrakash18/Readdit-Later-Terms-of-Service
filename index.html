            <h2>General Provisions</h2>

            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding 
                the extension and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.

            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full 
                force and effect, and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced with an enforceable provision that most 
                closely reflects the original intent.

            <h3>No Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            </p>

            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>
                You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign 
                our rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction.
